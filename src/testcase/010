Three things for your general edification/amusement:

For those interested, there is a program called 9x in
ftp.cs.su.oz.au:/matty which provides a remote graphical connection
to a Plan 9 machine on an X terminal.  The code needs to be cleaned up
(please don't look at it too much if you get it -- I will be mortified
if you do), and it doesn't support the polysegment primitive as yet,
but it's useful if you can get it to work nevertheless.  You will
need the libXg library from research.att.com (the one with the sam
distribution) to build it.
